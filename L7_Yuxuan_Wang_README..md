## Notes

1. Dashboard page is a dummy info page, no functionaity  except the *(go to Profile)*  
button actually works, please don't try to click them. It won't crash, but just  
doesn't do anything.  
*(go to Profile)* button works fine, it takes you back to the profile page.

2. texts in the dashboard page are made up from me.
